    "### Python environment\n",
    "When opening a notebook, you may be **prompted** to select the Python environment with which to run it (which must contain Iris, Jupyter, PyVista etc).  \n",
    "We suggest that you launch the Jupyter server _itself_ in the dedicated (conda) tutorial env. Then you can simply use the _same_ env as the server, i.e. select \"`Python 3 (ipykernel)`\".\n",

    "       * grey circle = \"busy\"\n",
    "       * \"electric zap\" icon = \"connecting\"  ***-- this one often means \"crashed\"***\n",

    "        2. after resetting, **do not attempt anything further** until the kernel state shows \"idle\" again\n",
    "   3. sometimes gets *really* stuck  \n",
